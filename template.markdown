# Nicholas Martinez - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

In module one I set out the learn Ruby. The progress I have made throughout the module is fantastic. I realized throughout the mod that computer programming is much more creative than I thought it was coming into Turing. I have really had to work on adjusting the way I approach problems and think about the projects. I am focusing on TDD throughout the Headcount projects rather than diving head first into code. The number one critique of my work has been about refining the process of my work.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

#### (Datenight)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/NZenitram/datenight)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/date_night.markdown)

The goal of the project was to build a binary search tree using ruby.

1. Functional Expectations
1: Application is missing more than one base expectation

2. Test-Driven Development
2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear

4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
2: Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring

5. Looping or Recursion
3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques
