# Nicholas Martinez - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

In module one I set out the learn Ruby. The progress I have made throughout the module is fantastic. I realized throughout the mod that computer programming is much more creative than I thought it was coming into Turing. I have really had to work on adjusting the way I approach problems and think about the projects. I am focusing on TDD throughout the Headcount projects rather than diving head first into code. The number one critique of my work has been about refining the process of my work.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

#### Datenight

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/NZenitram/datenight)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/date_night.markdown)

The goal of the project was to build a binary search tree using ruby.

1. Functional Expectations  
1: Application is missing more than one base expectation

2. Test-Driven Development  
2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components  
2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear

4. Fundamental Ruby & Style  
2: Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring

5. Looping or Recursion  
3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques

#### Event Reporter

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/NZenitram/event-reporter)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/event_reporter.markdown)

In Event Reporter I learned how to build a relational database with data from CSV tables. 

1. Functional Expectations  
3: Application fulfills all base expectations

2. REPL Interface  
3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use

3. Test-Driven Development  
2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

4. Breaking Logic into Components  
3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage

5. Fundamental Ruby & Style  
3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

6. Enumerable & Collections  
3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques

7. HTML and Style  
3: HTML is valid and has all correct data.


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

(Intro)

#### Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Robbie-Smith/Enigma)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown)

In Enigma we built an encrypting and decrypting program that mirrors Alan Turing's machine built during WWII. 

Notes:

28 tests all pass, one skip
Tests are overall good growth, don't quite feel fluent/full, but good progress
implementation is pretty good
some over-use of instance variables
a little bit of leaky abstraction when encapsulating functionality
watch out for "code smells" that show you weakness


1. Overall Functionality  
3: Application encrypts, decrypts, and cracks files as described

2. Fundamental Ruby & Style  
3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

3. Test-Driven Development  
3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.

4. Breaking Logic into Components  
3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
