# Nicholas Martinez - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

In module one I set out the learn Ruby. The progress I have made throughout the module is fantastic. I realized throughout the mod that computer programming is much more creative than I thought it was coming into Turing. I have really had to work on adjusting the way I approach problems and think about the projects.
